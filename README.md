# Metaphor detection for German Poetry

This repository contains the datasets POEMS and TSV described in the paper Metaphor detection for German Poetry (2019).
TSV is based on the English dataset of Tsvetkov et al. (2014).

## Data 

The folders contain the following data:

- **poems**: POEMS dataset (train and test)
- **tsv-translated**: TSV dataset (train and test)

In both folders, the files are organized as follows:

- Training data: files starting with `train_`
- Test data: files starting with `test_`

- Metaphorical instances: files ending with `_met`
- Non-metaphorical instances: files ending with `_nonmet`
- Ambiguous instances: files ending with `_ambig` 

Each file contains one lemmatized adjective-noun pair per line.

Please note that ambiguous instances were not used in experiments.
